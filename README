# Canadarm3

## Overview

This domain models some of the functionality and the safety protocols of the Canadarm3, Canada's contribution to NASA's Lunar Gateway. 
Since the robotic arm will function autonomously for the most part, there is a necessity to ensure that its safety protocols are robust.

The motivation behind this model is to ensure that there are no logical gaps in the safety protocols outlined for the Canadarm3.
This model uses PDDL+ to model its hybrid domain. The way this model falsifies the off-nominal behaviours is by feeding problem files
that are intended to produce failure states and seeing if the planner is able to produce a plan to achieve this failure state. 

This model currently captures:
